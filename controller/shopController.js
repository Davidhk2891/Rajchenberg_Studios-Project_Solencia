// shopController handels all shop transactions
// shopController needs to access weaponsModel and consumablesModel
/* blacksmith needs to display in its option buttons for every weapon. Since there are too many 
    weapons, display 5, then in another location, have another blacksmith which will sell the
    next 5 weapons. Then in a more difficult location, have another blacksmith shop which will
    sell the rest.

    Then adjust the shop controller accordingly.

    This is quite the task.
